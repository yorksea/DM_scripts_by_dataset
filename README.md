BCO-DMO dataset scripts

Contrubuters should make a folder exactly as named on our data server (usually PI last name).  In the case of multiple datasets per PI, use of subfolders is fine.

Contents of the dataset folder should be exactly what was used during dataset production.

The readme in each folder should provide link to bco-dmo dataset page.
